# Ecommerce Point of Sale Web Application using Next.js

This project is a simple yet functional web application for an ecommerce point of sale system, built using Next.js.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oluwaseyi9325/seamlesspos
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd seamlesspos
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Starting the Mock API Server

To simulate a backend server, we use `json-server`:

1. Start the JSON mock API server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run mockApi
    ```

    This will start the JSON mock API server, and your mock API will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Starting the Development Server

To run the development server and view the application in your browser:

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server, and your application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL mentioned above.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that the mock API server is running alongside the development server to enable full functionality of the application.
